# Account_Ticketing_System

Additional business and data validation rules will be required to ensure a higher quality data store is 
maintained including security and overall application functionality.
Customers will be able to login using their credentials and have their own menu of options which 
include viewing their account information, creating a new ticket, viewing their active tickets, and 
managing their tickets.
Agents will have more features available from respective main menu options including viewing new 
tickets, viewing active tickets, managing tickets, and archiving closed tickets.
Persistent storage of data will be implemented so data can be stored (to files) when it changes and 
reloaded when the application is later restarted. An archiving feature will permit agents to move 
closed tickets to an archive data file which will help contribute towards better performance and limit 
resource usage by keeping the active ticket data set lean.
